# Synopsis

Deployed at https://svakam.github.io/bus-mall/.

This Code 201 Project with Code Fellows develops the skills of being able to create a constructor function, making a list of 20 products (objects) from it, and referencing each value of the object through control statement flows. I was fortunate enough to learn a little Canvas rendering (bar graph) by referencing the data in JS. Local storage was also implemented (JSON, stringify). 


# Motivation

This is a Code 201 project (Code Fellows) that further develops our HTML/JS/DOM referencing skills on top of implementing abstraction, single responsibility principle, etc.
